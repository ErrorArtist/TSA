This course covers the parts of univariate and multivariate time series analysis that are most relevant for analysing (macro)economic and financial time series.

For univariate time series these are:

- stationarity, ARMA models;
- unit root tests;
- Box-Jenkins method: identification, estimation and testing of ARIMA models;
- forecasting with ARIMA models;
- non-linear models, (G)ARCH models.
For multivariate time series the topics are:

- dynamic regressions, spurious regressions;
- vector autoregressive models, vector GARCH, state space models;
- trend, cointegration and error correction models.
Additional research topics will be covered, such as:

- nonlinear time series models;
- model/forecast averaging;
- (density) forecast evaluation.
